## Reflection

## How do I make sure my code works and is secure?  
I test everything to catch bugs and make sure it works as expected. For security, I validate inputs and handle errors to prevent issues.

## How do I understand user needs and build them into a program?  
I focus on what the user wants, plan features around those needs, and get feedback to make sure the program does what it should.

## How do I design software?  
I break things down into smaller pieces, plan out how they’ll work together, and write clean, simple code that’s easy to update later.
